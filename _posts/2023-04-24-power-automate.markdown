For those that don't have much experience coding, there are plenty of low-code solutions available. One of Microsoft's offerings is Power Automate (formerly Flow), which allows users to perform a wide variety of tasks that are straight-forward for a beginner coder to do, but are difficult for someone with no coding experience. There is a bit of a learning curve to the software, but it can be faster to learn and implement than learning Python.

A word of caution, however. While Power Automate (and presumably other low-code tools) can take you pretty far with run-of-the-mill business processes, there can be some frustrating shortcomings if your users have a very specific vision for what they'd like to see accomplished. So before you start diving in and making promises, be sure to do your homework and ensure that the functionality exists to deliver what you need it to.
